# Not-Going-To-Be-Commons-SSL

This is forked from Not-Yet-Commons-SSL 0.3.17, which used to be hosted at [http://www.juliusdavies.ca/commons-ssl/](http://www.juliusdavies.ca/commons-ssl/), but at the time of this writing is no longer available.

This project was created to keep the source open and available, and also in order to make it compatible with the newest versions of Java.
