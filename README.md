# Not-Going-To-Be-Commons-SSL

This was forked from Not-Yet-Commons-SSL 0.3.17, which used to be hosted at [http://www.juliusdavies.ca/commons-ssl/](http://www.juliusdavies.ca/commons-ssl/), but at the time of this writing is no longer available.

This project was created to keep the source open and available, and also in order to make it compatible with the newest versions of Java.

In the original author's own words, the Not-Yet-Commons-SSL project should be considered to be of "alpha" quality only. There are other libraries (like [Apache HttpComponents](https://hc.apache.org/index.html)) you can use to work with SSL contexts or socket factories, that are also in active development with a large community. The reason you're here is probably that you're using another library that _depends_ on Not-Yet-Commons-SSL, and are running into issues with it on Java 9 or greater.
